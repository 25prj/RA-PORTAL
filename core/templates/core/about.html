            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                <strong>Type Approval</strong> is a certification process conducted by the National Communications
                Authority (NCA) to ensure that electronic communication equipment meets the required technical standards
                and regulations before being sold or used in Ghana.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                This process is mandatory for all telecommunications and electronic devices, including mobile phones,
                radios, and other wireless equipment, to ensure they are safe, efficient, and compatible with Ghana's
                communication networks.

                A <strong>Dealership License</strong> is a permit issued by the NCA to individuals or businesses that
                wish to sell or distribute electronic communication equipment in Ghana. This license ensures that
                dealers operate legally and adhere to NCA regulations.
